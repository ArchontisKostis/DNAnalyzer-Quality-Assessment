# `Analyzer` Class

This class is used to perform a variety of analyses on a given `DNA` object.

## Properties

- `analysis`: An object of type Analysis, which contains the DNA object to be analyzed, as well as other information needed for the analysis.
- `proteinAnalyzer`: An object of type ProteinAnalyzer, which is used to analyze the proteins found in the DNA object.
- `nucleotideCounter`: An object of type NucleotideCounter, which is used to count the nucleotides in the DNA object.
- `result`: An object of type AnalysisResult, which will hold the results of the analysis.

## Methods
### `public Analyzer(Analysis analysis)`
This constructor creates a new Analyzer object and initializes it with the given Analysis object. It also creates a new AnalysisResult object and associates it with the analysis property.

### `private void init(Analysis analysis)`
This method is called by the constructor to initialize the proteinAnalyzer and nucleotideCounter properties. It also performs some basic validation on the DNA object in the Analysis object.

### `public void begin(boolean reverseIsSelected)`
This method is called to begin the analysis. If reverseIsSelected is true, it will reverse the sequence of the DNA object.

### `public void analyzeProteins()`
This method analyzes the proteins in the DNA object and sets the results in the result object.

### `public void searchForHighCoverageRegions()`
This method searches for high coverage regions in the proteins in the DNA object and sets the results in the result object.

### `public void findLongestProtein()`
This method finds the longest protein in the DNA object and sets the result in the result object.

### `public void configureReadingFrames(int minCount, int maxCount)`
This method configures the reading frames for the DNA object and sets the result in the result object.

### `public void analyzeProteinSequence()`
This method analyzes the protein sequence in the DNA object and sets the result in the result object.
